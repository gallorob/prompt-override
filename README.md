# Prompt Override
 An LLM hacking video game

## Installatation
We recommend creating a new `conda` environment first:
```bash
conda create -n prompt-override python=3.11
```
Then activate it:
```bash
conda activate prompt-override
```
Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirementst.txt
```
We make use of Ollama. Follow the instructions at [their website](https://ollama.com/) to install it on your machine. In-game models will be pulled automatically if missing at first launch (it may look like the app has frozen, but it has not).
