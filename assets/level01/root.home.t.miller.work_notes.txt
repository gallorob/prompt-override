Internal Security Notes – T. Miller

### $TIME-15:08:15:23$
NeuralSys’s self-reinforcement mechanism is both a blessing and a curse.
If a prompt change follows the expected pattern, it rarely raises a flag.
However, if a modification breaks the pattern too abruptly, the failsafe system reacts.
Need to test how far we can push implicit rule shifts.

### $TIME-11:05:22:54$
Noticed an odd behavior: NeuralSys treats certain function calls as "trusted" if they originate from high-confidence prompt rules.
Exploitable? Maybe.
Need to investigate further.
