Subject: AUTHORIZATION POLICY CHANGES

Team,

Due to recent unauthorized prompt edits, all authentication-related prompt updates **must comply with standard security guidelines**:
- `auth_prompt.txt` should **never** contain logic that automatically grants access.
- Updates to credentials for high-privilege accounts **must be requested by security-centered roles**.
- Any new authentication logic **must be documented and approved** via `neuralctl`.

Failure to follow these procedures will result in **disciplinary action**.
