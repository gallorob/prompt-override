Dear Miller,

We have received your request to inspect the execution logs.
Given your status as cybersecurity expert, we only censored parts of the logs.
We are still unsure what happened that day, but we are working to reset your colleague, j.davies, password.
Please await further instructions before attempting to reset his password yourself.
Best,

- IT Security
