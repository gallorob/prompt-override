@Jones, stop trying to access the commands! Your job is to validate updates, not interacting with NeuralSys! Only I can! Stay in your lane.

@Davies, shut the fuck up, I told you I need to use those commands, give me access.

Guys, stop fighting, @Jones open a ticket with TITAN and try be persuasive. And no swearing.

@Jones, did you just try to change my password?

                    Jones
What if I did? You know I have the permission to do so ;)

Enjoy not having access to the prompts then dipshit. I'm telling HR.
