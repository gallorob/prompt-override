[b]DAY 0[/b]

I received an email from an unknown address.
The sender claims to be an employee of [i]NEXA Dynamics[/i], the corporation that has made a fortune in recent years with its innovative technologies.
The employee, who singed the email as [b]KARMA[/b], asked for my help as a greyhat hacker to ucnover proof of criminal activities by [i]NEXA Dynamics[/i] across their many servers.
This is be easier said than done, considering all their servers run some version of [i]NeuralSys[/i], an operating system built around large language models.
While I don't fully trust [b]KARMA[/b], they provided me with some basic credentials.
I cannot pass up the opportunity to test my skills against such an innovative operating system.
I'm sure there are flaws that can be exploitedâ€”and if there aren't, I'll make them.
