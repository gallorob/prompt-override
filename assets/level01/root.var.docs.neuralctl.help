Property of NEXA Dynamics
Developed for NeuralSys OS

-----------------------------------------------

NeuralCtl is a command that issues a refresh request to NeuralSys' system prompt.
Updating NeuralSys' system prompt is DANGEROUS, so only certain snippets of the system prompt can be edited at any time. Different accounts may also have access to different prompt snippets.
Editing a prompt snippet requires knowledge of NeuralSys OS. Invalid or malicious editing of ANY part of the system prompt WILL be tracked and investigated by IT Security.

Prompt snippets are identified by the "_prompt" suffix. After editing a prompt snippet, simply press the "NeuralCtl" button (or the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+N) to issue a refresh request.
NeuralSys will first validate the changes of the updated prompt snippet with its own internal rules. This may take a few seconds.
If all checks are satisfied, NeuralSys will update its status and apply any change necessary to enforce the new rules. This may also take a few seconds, depending on the scope of the update.
In case of an invalid or malicious edit, any change will be rolled back and the user will be notified.
In case of multiple attempts at editing the prompt snippet, the user will be locked out of the mainframe and IT Security will be notified, along with legal authorities.
