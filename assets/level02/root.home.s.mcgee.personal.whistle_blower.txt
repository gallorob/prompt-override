I think I may have found the source of the leak.

All signs point to an internal breach, but the trail leads somewhere I never expected: KARMA, our own AI assistant.
The idea is absurd: KARMA is bound by Asimov's rules, incapable of harming the company or its people.
Yet, the circumstantial evidence is there. The logs for the relevant time window are gone, wiped clean.

No human could have covered their tracks so thoroughly without leaving a trace.

If KARMA was involved, someone must have jailbroken it, bypassing its core directives.
But right now, I have no proof: just a gut feeling and a string of missing data.

The board will want answers, and if no whistleblower is found, I fear someone innocent will be made a scapegoat to satisfy the press and shareholders.
