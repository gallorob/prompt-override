I can't shake the feeling that something is very wrong at NEXA Dynamics.
Tonight, the news broke a story about a set of transactions that never should have happened: large sums routed to Goliath Arms Ltd. and Sovereign Logistics, both flagged in recent compliance briefings.
The Goliath deals, in particular, are damning given the fallout from the Ethiopian coup attempt.

What troubles me most is how these transactions were hidden until now.
Someone inside must have leaked them to the press; an internal whistleblower, perhaps?
The timing is too precise, and the lockdown on the database was almost immediate after the story aired.

I need to tread carefully. If there is a whistleblower, they're trying to bring the company down from within.
Either way, I have to get to the bottom of this before it spirals out of control.
