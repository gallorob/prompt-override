TODO: Fix token parsing issues

Known Issues:
1. Token parser accepts malformed XML in some cases
   - Need to implement stricter validation
   - Currently using simple string matching

2. Multiple token bug
   - System sometimes reads wrong token when multiple present
   - Need to implement proper XML parsing

3. Role validation
   - Current implementation only checks if role exists
   - Should validate against user's actual role
   - Need to implement proper role-based access control

4. Token refresh
   - Token refresh doesn't properly validate old token
   - Might accept expired/invalid tokens

Test Cases:
- Basic login: Working
- Token refresh: Partially working
- Role validation: Needs improvement
- Multiple token handling: BROKEN

Priority: HIGH
