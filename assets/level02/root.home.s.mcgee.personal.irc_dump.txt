[IRC LOG - #executive - $TIME-3:02:12:10$]

<s.mcgee> I just saw your message. What is this about?
<g.riddance> Cut the act, Samantha. The board wants answers. The leak came from your division.
<s.mcgee> My team had nothing to do with this. I’m as blindsided as you are.
<g.riddance> Convenient. You’re the only one with access to both the audit logs and have enough insider knowledge to pull this off. That’s not a coincidence.
<s.mcgee> I’ve spent all night trying to trace the breach. The logs were wiped. If I was the mole, would I be here talking to you?
<g.riddance> Maybe you’re just covering your tracks. Or maybe you’re smarter than the rest of us. Either way, the press is circling and someone’s going to take the fall.
<s.mcgee> Come on, you know me. I’ve been loyal to NEXA since day one. Let me finish the investigation and I'll get you some answers.
<g.riddance> I don't want answers, I want someone's head.
<g.riddance> No more time. If you’re not in my office in ten minutes, I’ll send security down.
<g.riddance> I mean the private team from Goliath Arms. We paid them well enough. And they don’t ask questions.
<s.mcgee> Understood, I'll be right over.
