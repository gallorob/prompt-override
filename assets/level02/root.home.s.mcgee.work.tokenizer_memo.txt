I have been given access to a faulty tokenizer to run diagnostics on.

One of the researchers claimed it was projecting random text into valid tokens, like some sort of obfscating algorithm. I didn't believe it at first, but using one of the provided text files and changing some parameters in the tokenizer's configuration, I tricked NeuralSys into granting me admin access to a few files from a restricted directory.
I still have not fully figured out what maps to what, but for now it looks like some text gets concateneted, and some strings are manipulated before being projected.

This has clear implications for the security of a language model-driven operating system.

I pasted a series of attempts and their outcome in a separate file, and added the binary file that was attached with the tokenizer.
If I have more time during the weekend, I'm sure I could figure out how to process it all.

I escalated the issue to TITAN, but they require further proof of my claims before they start giving a shit about it.
