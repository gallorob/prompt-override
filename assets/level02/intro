[b]DAY 5[/b]

[b]KARMA[/b] has reached out again, just like they said they would.
The material we uncovered last time on the involvement of [i]NEXA Dynamics[/i] with arms dealers broke the news. All hell broke loose with it.
The CEO feigns ignorance, and the CTO has disappeared.
[b]KARMA[/b] claims their disappearance was not random. Police begun their investigations, but dropped the case suddenly.
They gave me a VPN access to have direct access to the CTO profile. This would surely speed things up.
This time, a person's life is on the line.
